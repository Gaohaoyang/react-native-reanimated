# Troubleshooting

Reanimated is known for its stability and compatibility so it's extremely unlikely you will ever have to visit this page. If you had to, please contact us at `contact@swmansion.com`.

## Version mismatching

Reanimated has four core components that compose its code:

- C++,
- Java,
- JavaScript,
- Reanimated Babel Plugin.

All of them are supposed to work correctly only within the same version. Therefore, having any of those pieces in your code - directly or indirectly - separate from `react-native-reanimated`, especially having your code transpiled with a different version of the plugin, will result in undefined behavior and errors. Especially having code transpiled with an outdated version of `Reanimated Babel Plguin` is a common source of errors.

### [Reanimated] Unknown version of Reanimated Babel plugin

1. Try resetting your Metro bundler cache with `yarn start --reset-cache`, `npm start -- --reset-cache` or `expo start -c` and run the app again.
2. Make sure that none of your dependencies contains already transformed worklets bundled with an outdated version of the Reanimated Babel plugin.
3. Using release bundle with debug build of the app is not supported.

### [Reanimated] Mismatch between JavaScript code version and Reanimated Babel plugin version

1. Try resetting your Metro bundler cache with `yarn start --reset-cache`, `npm start -- --reset-cache` or `expo start -c` and run the app again.
2. Make sure that none of your dependencies contains already transformed worklets bundled with an outdated version of the Reanimated Babel plugin.

### [Reanimated] Using dev bundle in a release app build is not supported

Visit https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated/issues/4737 to find more information on how to fix this issue.

### [Reanimated] Tried to synchronously call a non-worklet function on the UI thread

Possible solutions are:

1. If you want to synchronously execute this method, mark it as a worklet.
2. If you want to execute this function on the JS thread, wrap it using `runOnJS`.

### [Reanimated] Failed to create a worklet

Did you forget to add Reanimated Babel plugin in babel.config.js? See installation docs at https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/installation#babel-plugin.

### [Reanimated] Another instance of `react-native-reanimated` was detected

Very bad!!!

### [Reanimated] The native part of Reanimated doesn't seem to be initialized

This could be caused by:

- not rebuilding the app after installing or upgrading Reanimated,
- trying to run Reanimated on an unsupported platform,
- running in a brownfield app without manually initializing the native library.

### [Reanimated] Couldn't determine the version of the native part of Reanimated

Did you forget to re-build the app after upgrading react-native-reanimated? If you use Expo Go, you must use the exact version which is bundled into Expo SDK.

### [Reanimated] Mismatch between JavaScript part and native part of Reanimated

Did you forget to re-build the app after upgrading react-native-reanimated? If you use Expo Go, you must downgrade to ${cppVersion} which is bundled into Expo SDK.

### [Reanimated] Couldn't determine the version of the native part of Reanimated

Did you forget to re-build the app after upgrading react-native-reanimated? If you use Expo Go, you must use the exact version which is bundled into Expo SDK.

### [Reanimated] Mismatch between JavaScript part and native part of Reanimated

TBD

### [Reanimated] Native side failed to resolved JS version of `react-native-reanimated`

TBD

### [Reanimated] Native mismatch between JS version of `react-native-reanimated` and C++ version

TBD

### [Reanimated] Multiple versions of Reanimated were detected in `build.gradle`

Only one instance of react-native-reanimated can be installed in a project. You need to resolve the conflict manually. Check out the documentation: https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/troubleshooting#multiple-versions-of-reanimated-were-detected\n\n

### [Reanimated] Outdated version of `react-native` for New Architecture

Reanimated supports only on the latest minor release of React Native. Please upgrade to React Native 0.72.0 or downgrade to an older version of Reanimated v3."

### [Reanimated] Native side failed to resolve Java code version

TBD

### [Reanimated] Native side (Java) failed to resolve JS version of `react-native-reanimated`

TBD

### [Reanimated] Native mismatch between JS version of `react-native-reanimated` and Java version

TBD
